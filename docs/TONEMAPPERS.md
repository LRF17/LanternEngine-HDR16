# Native+ tone mappers (0.9.38.3)

Native+ has three tone mappers: **Vanilla+** (the default), **PsychoV** and **PsychoV+**. This
page says how each is built, why, what was measured (on a model with RenoDX's own code, and in the game), and what
was tried and not kept. The code is the one the workflow builds: Lantern 0.9.38 (`4715bca`) with
`ports/lantern/nativeplus-engine.patch`; the references are RenoDX `b6b32f4` (`test30.hlsl`,
`test17.hlsl`, `DICE.hlsl`, `color/correct.hlsl`, the Cyberpunk 2077, Order of the Sinking Star,
Starfield and FromSoftware Engine mods, `.agents/skills/handle-sdr-tonemap-lut`) and souperman9's
`renodx-bloodborne.addon64` (its shaders, decompiled; its Bloodborne branch is not public).

Each point is marked **[contract]** (required by the tone mapper's own code or comments),
**[RenoDX]** (what RenoDX's mods do), **[deduction]** (this page's reasoning or model),
**[measured]** (an HDR capture in the game) or **[to measure]**.

## The chain

Both tone mappers run in Native+'s replacement of the game's final composite
(`bb_composite_hdr.frag`), on the game's own inputs:

1. **Scene**: the game's HDR scene (RGBA16F, before its tone curve) times its tint, gain and
   vignettes: `x`, linear BT.709, exactly as the game computes it (`bb_composite.glsl`, written
   from the game's shader code for all 1380 variants of its composite).
2. **Curve**: the tone mapper's signal in place of the game's curve (below).
3. **Bloom** `g` (the game's bloom texture, B10G11R11 float, with its tint), added to that signal.
4. **Color matrix** (the game's 3x4 matrix, rows 840..851; desaturation that varies by place).
5. **Roll-off** to the display's peak, in units of the game's white (peak / Game Brightness).
6. The result encoded as the game encodes (its gamma), written as the difference with the game's
   own output into the composite's RGBA16F target, so the target holds the HDR color plus the
   game's grain.
7. **Color table** (`bb_color_grading.frag`): the game's 16^3 table, exactly as the game applies
   it up to white; above white the color divided by its largest channel, graded, scaled back; a
   color outside BT.709 through RenoDX's gamut bridge.
8. Copies, the game's DLAA, the upscaler: all in 16-bit (RGBA16F) in Native+.
9. **Final pass** (`hdr_output.frag`): decode (pure 2.2), BT.709 to BT.2020, what is still below
   0 dropped, times Game Brightness, each channel clipped at the peak, PQ. The HUD is told apart
   by luminance against a copy taken before the game draws it.

## Vanilla+

By **souperman9**, from his RenoDX Bloodborne mod, confirmed in his addon's shaders
**[contract: the addon]**:

- **Curve**: the game's curve below a *scene* value of 0.18, its tangent above, per color
  channel: the scene's range from 0.5 to 2 (lanterns, flames, lit walls) is 1.4 to 4 times the
  game's.
- **Bloom** added unbounded (`+ bloom`, no clamp), then the color matrix.
- **Roll-off**: the menu's grading (RenoDX's user grading), then `CInfinityRollOff` (anchor 0.18,
  strength 1.5) on each channel to the peak.

The game's shadows and hues (its curve works per channel, as the game's own SDR image), bright
mid-highlights; the brightest lights reach the peak early and turn white.

Native+ differs from the addon in where it rolls off (before the color table, the addon after
it, in its LUT pass), in its color table bridge (Exact up to white; the addon compresses the max
channel with `CInfinityRollOff` around the table, in the encoded domain) and in its decoding (2.2;
the addon sRGB or 2.2). These change saturated highlights through a strong table, not the
brightness **[to measure]**.

## PsychoV and PsychoV+

Both are RenoDX's **PsychoV-30** (`psychotm_test30`, ported to GLSL and checked against RenoDX's
HLSL below), built in four steps, each from a difference seen in the game; they differ in the
first step only. PsychoV (`hdr_tonemapper=4`) is PsychoV-30's own curve; PsychoV+ (7, called
PsychoV in 0.9.38.2) takes Vanilla+'s curve above mid grey, an idea taken from the FromSoftware
Engine RenoDX mod's structure (a game curve continued above mid grey, then a PsychoV as the
display mapping), not its operator.

1. **Signal.** On the scene's luminance `y` (the color's ratios kept), `v = 0.18 (y / grey_in)^cone`,
   `grey_in` where the game's curve gives mid grey (0.18), `cone` the game's log-log slope there.
   PsychoV-30 anchored at `grey_in` with that cone maps a grey exactly as it maps this `v` from mid
   grey with a cone of 1 **[contract: test30's F]**: PsychoV's greys are PsychoV-30's own.
   PsychoV+ keeps that `v` below `grey_in` (PsychoV-30's shadows) and takes Vanilla+'s extended
   curve above it, scaled to meet at `grey_in`: PsychoV-30 tends to the peak only as the light
   grows without bound (half the peak around x = 3); on this signal its highlights are Vanilla+'s
   brightness.
2. **Bloom** added unbounded to that signal, then the color matrix, in Vanilla+'s order. PsychoV-30
   alone took the game's screen blend, `t + clamp(g) (1 - min(t, 1))`: its per-channel clamp turned
   an orange glow yellow-green. Measured on the spires before the sunset, green to red 1.03 against
   Vanilla+'s 0.53, saturation 0.44 against 0.76 **[measured]**.
3. **PsychoV-30** on the scene color whose signal that is (`grey_in (v / 0.18)^(1 / cone)` on the
   luminance), anchored at `grey_in` with the game's slope as `cone_response_exponent`, as
   RenoDX's mods pass a vanilla slope **[RenoDX]**: its compression to the peak, purity, BT.2020
   target and gamut compression, and the menu's sliders as its own parameters.
4. **Hue correction** to Vanilla+'s output for the same pixel (RenoDX's `correct::Hue`, OKLab:
   PsychoV-30's lightness and chroma, Vanilla+'s hue, strength 1; as RenoDX's `HueOKLab` without its
   final AP1 clamp, which the final pass's BT.2020 makes moot). PsychoV-30 compresses each cone's
   response, so a bright orange (L far above M) moves towards yellow and a violet towards pink, as
   the eye sees a strong light; the game's curve, per channel, keeps the artists' hues: the game's
   SDR image shows its fires orange. In the game the fires had turned yellow: OKLab hue 66 to 68
   degrees between 100 and 400 nits, against Vanilla+'s 55 to 59; with the correction 56 to 61
   against 54 to 58 **[measured]**. The
   reference is Vanilla+'s *final* color: its color before the roll-off made the brightest flames
   redder than Vanilla+ itself (46 degrees at x = 2 against 76) and the red channel passed the
   peak **[deduction]**.

Where the composite has no curve to extend (its curve 3), both fall back to PsychoV-30 on the
scene.

### Model

`engine/docs/hdr-tools/psychov_check/psychov_model.cpp` (run by `run.sh`), with RenoDX's own
test30: interiors (curve k 2.30, c 0.46: `grey_in` 0.19475, cone 1.1656), peak 1000 nits, Game
Brightness 203, the color matrix left out. PsychoV-30 alone (the tone mapper of 0.9.38.1, with
the game's screen-blended bloom and no hue correction) for reference **[deduction]**.

| Scene x | Game (SDR) | Vanilla+ | PsychoV-30 alone | PsychoV | PsychoV+ |

Colors (nits / OKLab hue / chroma per lightness):

| | Vanilla+ | PsychoV-30 alone | PsychoV | PsychoV+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flame orange (1, 0.45, 0.08) x 1 | 179 / 55 / 0.223 | 115 / 71 / 0.187 | 113 / 55 / 0.187 | 148 / 55 / 0.185 |

| Dark spire under a strong orange glow (green / red) | 213, 0.66 | 178, 0.96 | 198, 0.64 | 198, 0.64 |

No color is above the peak or outside BT.2020 in PsychoV's or PsychoV+'s output. PsychoV keeps
PsychoV-30's greys and chroma exactly, with Vanilla+'s hues and bloom.

### In the game

HDR captures of PsychoV+ against Vanilla+ (Xbox Game Bar JXR, 30/10/2026; peak 1037 nits, the
same settings at 50 in both presets) **[measured]**:

- **Moon, Yharnam at night**: 786 nits (median of the disc) against Vanilla+'s 870. The moon is
  between 1 and 3 times the game's white in the scene, where PsychoV's shoulder sits below
  Vanilla+'s (373 against 439 nits at x = 1 in the model).
- **Sun at sunset**: 1017 nits against 915. Vanilla+ rolls off each channel: an orange sun's
  blue stays low and its luminance tops out under the peak; PsychoV compresses the luminance itself
  to the peak.
- **Deep shadows** depend on the place. PsychoV continues the game's slope at mid grey downwards;
  the game's own curve is a straight line at the bottom (slope 1). Where the slope at mid grey is
  above 1 the blacks are deeper than Vanilla+'s (Yharnam at night: 25th percentile 2.0 against
  2.8 nits); where it is below 1, lighter (a dark interior: median 0.017 against 0.012 nit)
  **[deduction for the cause; the curve's parameters per place are not logged]**.
- **Fires and lanterns**: the hue is Vanilla+'s (above); the chroma stays PsychoV-30's, about 18 %
  lower around 100 to 400 nits (fire 0.139 against 0.168). That is PsychoV-30's purity near the
  peak; the Saturation slider raises it.

So, against Vanilla+, PsychoV+ has PsychoV-30's shadows, Vanilla+'s brightness for the brightest
lights, mid-bright sources (the moon, lamps) about 10 % lower, more gradation near the peak (+44
against +29 nits from x = 4 to 8), Vanilla+'s hues, softer colors near the peak. PsychoV has
PsychoV-30's whole curve: half Vanilla+'s nits around the game's white (215 against 439 at x = 1),
much more gradation near the peak (+178 nits from x = 4 to 8); its Highlights slider at 60 to 70
gives 290 to 377 nits at x = 1.

## PsychoV-30's integration

Kept in PsychoV and PsychoV+, which call the same port:

- **The game's slope as `cone_response_exponent`** (corrected in this beta). test30 takes its cone
  power as `contrast * cone_response_exponent` but its purity as `purity_scale / contrast`
  **[contract]**. Native+ passed the game's slope (1.05 to 1.17 in the scenes measured) as
  `contrast`, so it also took purity down by that much at neutral settings. RenoDX's mods pass a
  vanilla slope as `cone_response_exponent` (Cyberpunk 2077: `psychovConeResponse`; Order of the
  Sinking Star: `SinkingStarResolvePsychoVConeResponse`) **[RenoDX]**. Measured on RenoDX's own
  code: the luminance unchanged, the colors about 10 % more saturated (flame orange 0.787 to
  0.870, blood red 0.871 to 0.927, moon blue 0.603 to 0.648).
- Anchor and slope: `V(grey_in) = 0.18` and the game's `x V'(x) / V(x)` there, the skill's
  output-midgray anchor and cone formula **[RenoDX]**; measured on the output: V = 0.18000, slope
  1.1657 for the game's 1.1656 (interiors), 1.0461 for 1.0459 (outdoors).
- Compression `h = 1`: test30's default and Order of the Sinking Star's **[RenoDX]** (Cyberpunk
  2077 uses the automatic h). Not changed.
- BT.2020 target, full gamut compression, BT.709 source boundary: test30's defaults and the HDR
  mods' **[RenoDX]**. Negative BT.709 channels kept signed to the final pass, which converts to
  BT.2020 before dropping what is still negative.
- Gamma: the chain encodes with the game's gamma and decodes with 2.2, as RenoDX's Gamma
  Correction 2.2; the peak needs no pre-correction **[deduction]**.
- Not a cause of any difference: the color table bridge returns the color unchanged with an
  identity table (largest relative change 4e-16 on a grey ramp up to 6x white), the 16-bit chain
  keeps values above white through every pass, and the final pass only encodes.

## Tried and not kept

- **PsychoV-30 alone** (0.9.38.1's tone mapper, kept as PsychoV's curve): its bloom clamped per
  channel (glows turned yellow-green) and its hues moved by its cone compression (fires yellow,
  violets pink). PsychoV is that curve with both fixed.
- **PsychoV without the hue correction** (tried before this release, as PsychoV-30's fires were
  thought closer to the game's SDR image): the game's SDR image shows them orange, as with the
  correction.
- **PsychoV-17** (RenoDX's `psychotm_test17`, ported and checked within 7e-6, set as RenoDX's
  Starfield mod sets it): on greys PsychoV-30's curve exactly, its colors a little paler in the
  brightest saturated lights; the same as PsychoV-30 in the game. Removed before release.
- **DICE** (RenoDX `DICE.hlsl`) in place of Vanilla+'s roll-off: about as bright as Vanilla+,
  flat at the peak from x = 4, saturated colors' channels 2 to 3 times the peak (clipped).
- **The FromSoftware Engine mod's own operator** (Ritsu; Elden Ring, Nightreign, Sekiro, Armored
  Core VI: a per-cone Reinhard with the luminance restored and Neutwo on the largest channel),
  compiled unchanged on Vanilla+'s extended curve: brighter than Vanilla+ up to x = 4 (927 against
  819 nits at x = 2), flat at the peak above it, flame saturation 0.49 at x = 5. PsychoV+ keeps its
  structure with PsychoV-30.
- **PsychoV-30 after Vanilla+'s bloom and matrix with the game's curve below mid grey**, and
  **PsychoV-30 driven to Vanilla+'s luminance**: Vanilla+'s shadows (not PsychoV-30's), whiter
  colors (flame saturation 0.37 and 0.35 at x = 5).

None was taken as better for reaching the peak more often.

## Checks run

- Engine build, settings tests (`hdr_tonemapper` 4 and 7 kept, 0, 2, 3 and 6 read as Vanilla+),
  the host shader configurations compiled and validated (`shader_check.py`).
- `engine/docs/hdr-tools/psychov_check/run.sh`: the GLSL PsychoV-30 against RenoDX's HLSL compiled
  unchanged, on 791 colors (grey ramp 1e-4..1e4, 18 hues at 40 levels, out-of-gamut, extremes):
  max difference 2e-4 of the color's largest channel over 9 configurations; no NaN or infinite
  value; the grey ramp monotonic and continuous. Then `psychov_model.cpp`: the tables above.
- HDR captures in the game, Vanilla+ against PsychoV+ at each step (above).
- The game's color table, read back from the GPU by the log line (0.9.38.3): a 16x16x16
  `R32G32B32A32Sfloat` table that grades the image a little, mean change 4.6/255 against a neutral
  table, largest 18/255, slightly warm (white 255, 251, 243; mid grey 137, 138, 134 for 136)
  **[measured]**. The game stops drawing its grading pass at times (loading screens, menus, some
  places); Color Grade Strength then has nothing to change.

**Not run:** RenderDoc captures of each stage; the curve's parameters (832, 833) per place.

## Capture procedure

Same save, same place, same camera, the game's Brightness at 5, the same Native+ settings except
the tone mapper; no upscaler first, then the one you use.

1. Places: a lantern in a dark street (Central Yharnam), a fire, the moon (Hunter's Dream /
   Cathedral Ward), the sun at the Grand Cathedral, a dark interior.
2. For Vanilla+, PsychoV and PsychoV+, Bloom 50 then 0:
   - an HDR screenshot (Xbox Game Bar, Win+Alt+PrtScn: a JXR) for nits; read the luminance and the
     largest channel separately (they differ for colors: a red at 1000 nits in its red channel is
     about 260 nits of luminance), and the hue in OKLab;
   - Test probe 1 (the composite's HDR part), 2 (the final image above white), 6 (colors outside
     BT.709): a normal screenshot each.
3. One frame with RenderDoc (Vulkan) per tone mapper: the composite draw (`bb_composite_hdr`: its
   scene input `x` and bloom input `g` texels on the lantern, its RGBA16F target), the color table
   draw (input / output), the final pass (PQ output). Note the composite's constants 832, 833
   (curve) and 840..851 (matrix) for that place.
4. Log the HDR chain once (Debug) in each place, and send `logs/last_session.log`.
